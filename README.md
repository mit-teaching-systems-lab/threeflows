# Practice spaces for teacher preparation programs

> "We conclude that, in the program we studied, prospective teachers have fewer opportunities to engage in approximations that focus on contingent, interactive practice than do novices in the other two professions we studied."
Grossman et al. ([2009](https://cset.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/files/documents/publications/Grossman-TeachingPracticeACross-ProfessionalPerspective.pdf))

## Design notes
Draft quality [design notes](design-notes.md).

## Diagram and example scenarios
![diagram](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tsl-public/teacher-moments-diagram.png)

## Local software development
This is a [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) webapp, and a small [Express](http://expressjs.com/) server.
Code in both environments is written in [ES6](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/).

To develop locally:
```
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

This will both run the server and a process that will continually build the UI, writing the output of both to stdout in parallel.

#### Server
The server app was developed for the [engine specified in the root package.json](https://github.com/mit-teaching-systems-lab/threeflows/blob/master/package.json#L5).

If you already have node installed, you can check the version with `node -v`.  If you need to install node from scratch, follow the instructions for the current version on the [node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

[Install Postgres](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql#set-up-postgres-on-mac).

Seed the database to store text responses:
```
$ yarn db-create-dev

```
- For storing audio files, you'll need keys authorized for a development S3 bucket.
- For transcribing audio files, you'll need keys authorized for accessing the Watson Speech to Text API. Details on [how to use the API](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/speech-to-text/api/v1/) can be found on their website.

Ask someone for these keys.

#### Viewing data
To view data, go to `localhost:3000/login` in your web browser. You can use the default `test@mit.edu` email to login. A link should appear in your terminal for verification. 

Note: This only gives you access to the Researcher Portal. The `test@mit.edu` default user does not have access to any data. You can fix this by adding entries to the `whitelist` and `access` databases and using the corresponding urls when generating local development data.


Now you can play around with the app locally!



## UI tools
The project is built with [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) and uses Babel via [bablify](https://github.com/babel/babelify) to transpile ES6 and JSX.  It also uses [livereactload](https://github.com/milankinen/livereactload) for hot reloading of React components in local development.

For static analysis, we're experimenting with [eslint](http://eslint.org/) and [Flow](https://flowtype.org/).  The configuration for eslint uses [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react) and [babel-eslint](https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint).  None of these tools trigger build failures right now, but can be run locally.

You may also want to check out [react-devtools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools), which is a Chrome plugin that is especially helpful for navigating apps and discovering which parts of the product correspond to which React components.

### Type check with Flow
This starts a [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) server in the background, and then runs a typecheck once.  There's no watch command right now.
```
client $ yarn run flow-quiet
```

### Lint and fixup with eslint
```
client $ yarn run lint
```

### Run Jest tests
```
client $ yarn run jest
```

### Run all tests
This is used in CI, and runs any and all tests in the project including linting, typechecks and actual tests.
```
client $ yarn run test
```

### Sublime setup
If you're developing in Sublime, here's a recommended setup for niceties like code highlighting and inline lint errors:
 - [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) for installing Sublime packages
 - [babel-sublime](https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime) for syntax highlighting
 - [SublimeLinter-eslint](https://github.com/roadhump/SublimeLinter-eslint) for inline linting (not jshint)

## Heroku setup
You can do this through the Heroku CLI tools, or through the Heroku website.  These directions are for using the CLI tools on the command line.

Other Heroku docs:
- [Getting Started with Node.js on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs)
- [Heroku Node.js Support](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs-support)
- [Node.js on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/nodejs)
- [Best Practices for Node.js Development](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/node-best-practices)

### Initial setup
Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) installed.  To run remote Postgres commands you'll also need to [install Postgres locally](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql).

### Creating a new Heroku app
This is for creating a new Heroku app (eg, for a fork).

1. Clone the git repository to a folder on your computer.
2. In that folder, run `heroku create`.  You will probably want to name the app something specific as well, add the buildpacks, and make sure you create the app in the right Heroku team.
3. In the Heroku UI, add any add-ons (eg, Logentries, Rollbar, Postgres database).
4. Set up any other services or environment variable config (eg, AWS S3 bucket, Mailgun, IBM Watson).

### Setting up S3:
1. In S3, create new bucket with no public access
2. In IAM, create new "Server" user
3. Add bucket name, access key, secret and region to Heroku environment variable (eg, `MESSAGE_POPUP_S3_CONFIG_JSON`)
4. Try it out in the app!

### Setting up database
Create the database:
```
$ heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
```

### Database backups
Backups can be scheduled like so:

```
$ heroku pg:backups schedule DATABASE_URL --at '01:00 America/New_York'
Scheduled automatic daily backups at 01:00 America/New_York for DATABASE

$ heroku pg:backups schedules
=== Backup Schedules
DATABASE_URL: daily at 1:00 (America/New_York)
```

### Deploying to Heroku

```
$ git push heroku master
$ heroku open
```
or

## Maintaining Researcher Portal
### Whitelist database
Researchers and teacher educators (TEs) looking to use data collected in Teacher Moments must be registered with the Teaching Systems Lab. To give researchers and TEs access to the researcher portal, their email addresses must be manually added to the `whitelist` database.

### Access database
Once a researcher or TE has been given access to the portal, they need to be given access to a specific instance of Teacher Moments. 

For example, if they are using the Jessica Turner scenario for their thesis project, they might collect data using the following url: `https://teachermoments.teachingsystemslab.org/teachermoments/turner?KevinThesis20180319`. Teacher candidates would engage with the Teacher Moments simulation at that url and we would use that link to extract the data collected. To view the data, we would need to add an entry into the `access` database linking the TE's email to the url.

### Consented_Email database
All data collected by Teacher Moments is protected to ensure the privacy of participants. In order for a researcher or TE to view the data collected on a specific participant, the participant must fill out a [TSL consent form.](https://tsl.mit.edu/consent)

To update Teacher Moments on who has consented to share their data, you need to:
1. Download a CSV version of the consent spreadsheet. Search for `User Testing Consent Form (Responses)` in the TSL team Google Drive. Rename the file to `consented-latest-raw.csv` and save this file in the `threeflows/tmp` folder.

2. Run the prep-consent script to process the CSV file using
```
$ yarn run prep-consent
```
This should generate 1 file in the `threeflows/tmp` folder: `consented-latest.json`.

3. Run the update-consent script in heroku to update the live `consented_email` database and clean sensitive information from your codebase using
```
$ cat ./tmp/consented-latest.json | heroku run --no-tty yarn run update-consent | rm ./tmp/consented-latest.json ./tmp/consented-latest-raw.csv
```


## Other services
[Travis](https://travis-ci.org/mit-teaching-systems-lab/threeflows) is setup for CI.  It will run on pull requests and on commits to master.

On merging to master, Travis will trigger a build.  If that build passes, Heroku will deploy the app on its own.

## Creating a new simulation
In order to create a new simulation or scenarios, you need to follow these steps:

- **Create Experience Page:** Create an experience page (in `ui/src/message_popup/playtest` folder) to implement and connect the key components of your simulation such as the welcome page, the scenarios, and the summary page. In this experience page, you can use linear_session.jsx to step through all the questions, responses, and reviews that make up your scenarios. You can look at some of the other experience pages to get a better understanding of how this works. For example, danson_experience_page.jsx is for the [Lori Danson simulation](https://threeflows.herokuapp.com/teachermoments/danson) which consists of a background context, reflection questions, text scenarios and audio responses. turner_experience_page.jsx is for the [Jennifer Turner simulation](https://threeflows.herokuapp.com/teachermoments/turner), which has a similar structure as the Lori Danson simulation except that it consists of video scenarios and the audio recording begins immediately the scenario ends instead of requiring the user to click a button. There are other simulations that include a review after each response, multiple choice responses, and likert-scale responses.

- **Create Scenarios:** For many of the current simulations, the actual scenarios are contained in a separate file in the same folder as the experience page. The name of these files typically end in `_scenarios.js`. For example, the scenarios for `turner_experience_page.jsx` are contained in `turner_scenarios.js`. The scenarios get imported in the experience page.

- **Configure URL**: The URL for the simulations are configured in `ui/src/message_popup/index.js`. This is where you configure a URL that points to your experience page. Note that it requires you to configure a URL at the top of the file and then export your experience page at the bottom of the file.

- **Implement Logger and Data store**: If you follow a similar format to what we currently have in other experience pages and reuse existing components, your data will be stored in our current data stores i.e., postgres database for text and log messages, and Amazon S3 for audio recordings.
