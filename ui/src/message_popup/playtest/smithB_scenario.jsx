      `Imagine you're a teacher at a suburban high school. Your friend and experienced colleague, Mr. Smith, asks you to sit in and observe his CS class for a day.

The class, taught by Mr. Smith, has 6 students. The demographics of the class are as follows:

      5 Male Students
      1 Female Student
      4 White Students (3 Male, 1 Female)
      2 African American Students (2 Male)`

      `Mr. Smith will be teaching a class on encoding and sending formatted text. 

In doing so, his students will be working with the standard internet encoding protocol, ASCII. The class will be using pair programming to complete a project developing their own protocol for sending formatted (i.e bold, italicized, etc.) text.

<div>
  <div>Useful Knowledge:</div>
  <br />
  <div>ASCII is a protocol for representing alphabetic, numeric, and special characters with specific 7-bit binary numbers.</div>
  <br />
  <div>Binary is a number scheme that represents data through the use of only two possible digits: 0 or 1.</div>
  <br />
  <div>The term “Internet Simulator” will come up in some scenes. It is a tool which the students will use to test communication protocols on the internet.</div>
  <br />
  <div>If you don't entirely understand all the details of this lesson, that's just fine!  Accepting that uncertainty and doing your best within it is exactly what we're looking for.</div>

For each slide, take notes of what you are observing. Use both the images and text to get a feel for each scene. What did you notice? Was there anything worth mentioning to Mr. Smith? Think of these as personal notes you would jot down while observing the class. Remember, at the end you will be giving feedback to Mr. Smith! 

Try not to spend too much time on any one slide. There will be plenty of time to reflect at the end!
