      `Imagine you're a teacher at a suburban high school. Your friend and experienced colleague, Mr. Smith, asks you to sit in and observe his CS class for a day.

The class, taught by Mr. Smith, has 6 students. The demographics of the class are as follows:
  
  Cody: White Male
  George: White Male
  Jamal: African American Male
  Kevin: African American Male
  Molly: White Female
  Tim: White Male

      `Mr. Smith will be teaching a class on encoding and sending formatted text. 

In doing so, his students will be working with the standard internet encoding protocol, ASCII. The class will be using pair programming to complete a project developing their own protocol for sending formatted (i.e bold, italicized, etc.) text.

<div>
  <div>Useful Knowledge:</div>
  <br />
  <div>ASCII is a protocol for representing alphabetic, numeric, and special characters with specific 7-bit binary numbers.</div>
  <br />
  <div>Binary is a number scheme that represents data through the use of only two possible digits: 0 or 1. A bit, which is the smallest unit of information that can be stored on a computer, thus consists of a 1 or a 0.  </div>
  <br />
  <div>The term “Internet Simulator” will come up in some scenes. It is a tool which the students will use to test communication protocols on the internet.</div>
  <br />
  <div>If you don't entirely understand all the details of this lesson, that's just fine!  Accepting that uncertainty and doing your best within it is exactly what we're looking for.</div>

For each scene you will get 25 seconds to view the image and read the dialogue. Use both the images and text to get a feel for what is happening. After each scene you will be given a page to write down any notes or thoughts you have about the scene. What did you notice? Was there anything worth mentioning to Mr. Smith?  Think of these as personal notes you would jot down while observing the class. Remember, at the end you will be giving feedback to Mr. Smith! 

Try not to spend too much time writing notes on any one slide. There will be plenty of time to reflect at the end!
