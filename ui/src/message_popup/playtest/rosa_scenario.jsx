`In this scenario, you are teaching AP Computer Science Principles in a suburban high school where the students are predominantly white.

Before the semester, initial enrollments for your class showed that more boys than girls had signed up for your class. Upon seeing this, you decided to make a concerted effort to recruit more girls for your class. 
`});

  slides.push({ type: 'Context', text:
`Your efforts succeeded in getting more girls to enroll, but you ended up having an imbalance of girls to boys in the class. Out of 15 total students in your class, 10 of them are girls. 
`});

  slides.push({ type: 'Context', text:
`The semester has started and the deadline for students to make changes to their class schedule is a couple days away. Before the start of class one day, you overhear Rosa tell one of her classmates that she wants to switch out of your class. You are disappointed to hear this because Rosa is a strong student, excels at math, and is one of the few students of color in your class.
`});

  slides.push({ type: 'Context', text:
`At the end of class, you find Rosa before she leaves for her lunch break and ask her to stay after class to talk.

Improvise how you would act as a teacher, even if you don't have all the right answers or know the perfect thing to say.

Click and speak aloud the words you'd say to the student.

// Reflect

Before heading back to the group, let's shift to reflecting on what happened.
