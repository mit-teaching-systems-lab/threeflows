 stem+c grant for study implementation in ECS in chicago

 chicago CPS mandated HS CS course for graduation
 ECS is that course, along with AP

 we started looking at implementation of ECS
 learning outcomes, assessment by SRI
 data sharing with district
 looking at changes in enrollment
 positive experience in ECS, does it change likelihood of taking it again?

 looking at collecting classroom video
 25 videos - randy mcgee tekula
 working with partnership to collect T videos in classroom
 invited into classrom at convenience of Ts
 so don't always know what unit, etc.

 two videos robotics
 using robot that tacks on marker T wears
 additional microphones that captures S conversation

 ron greenberg at loyola
 bringing CS to chicago
 ron's area of research is robotics
 not a roboticist, doing outreach education
 MS/HS competitions, not first
 bot ball
 more accessible, starts at MS
 building/programming/documenting
 out of OK

 steve:
 looking at wide variety of lessons we've developed
 for our U students with ron, he'll zero in on robotics lessons
 in the proposal, we had proposed using danielson framework for coding videos for 2 reasons
 1: slight variation is what district uses for teacher eval system.  same categories, just tweak langauge around levels.  one outcome is to have examples for principals of how danielson play out in CS, as well as some details or nuances to framework for CS
 2: gates-funded MET they did study where they did classroom observations, coded to danielson, had students fill out Tripod 7C, found specific correlations.  trying to replicate.  at end of lesson we videorecord we have them fill out tripod 7c and student-level variables

 steve:
 did that with gail chapman
 to make specific dimensions of charlotte to three strands
 our thought was to collapse danielson strands
 we'd score teaching quality along three strands rather than more granular level

 interested in teacher bias
 with our video data, opportunity to layer that on and look at that

 training to uncover their implicit biases
 in line with philosphy and approach
