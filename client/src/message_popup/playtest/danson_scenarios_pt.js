      `You are a new teacher recently hired to work at Pleasantville High School, a small, suburban school within 1 hour’s drive of a major metropolitan city.

It is late July and you have spent most of your summer working at the school, getting your classroom established, preliminary units planned, and materials ready for the mid-August start of the school year. You have confirmed with your principal that you’ll be teaching primarily 9th and 10th grade this year.

As the summer has progressed, you’ve gotten to know the administration, the secretaries, and support staff. Few weeks before the first day of school, one of the guidance counselors comes to you, informing you that a parent wants to speak to you.

You are a bit surprised, as you didn’t expect parent conferences prior to actually teaching any students. When you question the counselor on what this conference is all about, the only background information she can provide is that this parent (Mrs. Lori Danson) and student (Brian Danson) are new to the school district and that Brian will soon be starting 9th grade. 

You agree to the conference and ask the counselor to arrange for the parent to come in next week.`

You will go through a set of scenarios that simulate the conversation between you and Mrs. Danson.

You need to provide an audio response to each prompt.

Please respond as quickly as possible (like you would do in a real conversation).

This may feel uncomfortable at first, but it's better to feel uncomfortable here than with a real parent.`

"I requested today's conference in order to get to know you better, to frankly and clearly discuss Brian and his needs, and to establish an early pattern of communication between you and me.

Brian was diagnosed with mild autism when he was 3 years old. As Brian entered and progressed through elementary school, I learned through experience that teachers often struggled with including Brian in regular education classrooms and providing him with formative and supportive learning environments.

Brian has had various struggles with teachers and peers. For example, he's been removed from a school party because of organizational difficulties such as forgetting to hand work in. Also, students have harassed him verbally and physically, for example, by spitting at him, even while teachers were nearby.

In spite of these challenges, he has been able to achieve various successes at school. For example, he has helped many teachers troubleshoot computer problems, he performed well in a solo singing part in a school play, and he gets high scores in math standardized tests.

I'm here just to try and advocate for my son and get him through the educational system.

I'd like to talk to you about some of the typical behaviors Brian exhibits and discuss how you will work with Brian if/when he exhibits these behaviors in class.

Could you please tell me what you know about autism."`
