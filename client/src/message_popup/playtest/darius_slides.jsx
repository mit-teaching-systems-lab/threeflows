Darius is not the only student who talks when he is not supposed to, but it seems like you hear his voice more often and louder than anyone else.
`});

slides.push({ type: 'Context', id: 'context_3', text:
`In class today, Darius walked out of class after you teacher called him out for talking when he was not supposed to be.  Darius had always been previously receptive to your efforts to mitigate his talking in class, so you've asked him to come by and talk after school.

Improvise how you would act as a teacher in those moments.  Click and speak aloud the words you'd say to Darius, or say nothing.

Ready to start?

Another time this week I we were talking about Michael Brown and Ferguson in class and the teacher asked me for the token Black opinion.

  <div>In the group, you'll be asked to describe what you noticed, any assumptions you made, and how that shaped your interactions with the student.</div>
