      `Imagine you are a new teacher recently hired to work at Pleasantville High School, a small, suburban school within 1 hour’s drive of a major metropolitan city.

You are beginning the second semester of your first year of teaching at Pleasantville HS. You've established an overall solid rapport with your students, as they recognize you as a teacher who is fair, consistent, knowledgeable, and has high expectations for student achievement.

One of your courses is a general course for 11th grade students. As a teacher, you believe that all students can learn. You structure your classes such that you support students as they grow intellectually while always keeping the academic pressure on, challenging them to continue advancing and to not become passive, stagnant individuals who just show up for class. This philosophy translates to a variety of independent in-class and out-of-class assignments. Never a fan of long lectures or worksheets, you structure most classes with a combination of mini-lectures, independent and group readings, and in-class projects or assignments. At times, students show frustration with the variety of learning activities. Some students appear to be more comfortable with you simply telling them what they will need to know, instead of challenging them to discover and construct knowledge themselves.

Amber Turner is a student in this class, but has made it clear that academics are not her focus. She is known throughout the small Pleasantville community as "the model," having appeared in several well-known clothing store and shoe commercials/photo shoots. Amber displays unmistakable arrogance and disdain for her peers and teachers.

It is clear to you that Amber sees high school as a waste or her time, as she is solely focused on her modeling career. The school's guidance counselor reports to you that she is maintaining a healthy "C" average in her other classes, In your class, though, her grades are in the low '60's, resulting from a variety of absences and incomplete work. When she is in attendance and completes her work, her grades are sufficient — not the best completed assignments you've ever seen, but not "F" quality either. Amber's facial expressions, vocal sighs, and rolling eyes tell you she'd prefer a class where she didn't have to work, and where you just gave her the info and she regurgitated it back to you on a test. Your constructivist approach to your subject, though, causes Amber and her peers to actually have to put forth some effort.

You know that Amber is frustrated, and you're not surprised when you receive a somewhat curt handwritten note from her mother, requesting a conference with you. You inform Amber of a day/time that best suits your schedule, telling Amber that you're happy to meet her mother at the school. In response, Amber gives you a smirk and a distinct "now you're going to catch hell" look.`

This may feel uncomfortable at first, but it's better to feel uncomfortable here than with a real parent.`
