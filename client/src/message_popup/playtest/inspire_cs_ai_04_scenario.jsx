Middle school A is in an affluent area, Middle School B is from the railtrack  working parents neighborhood and Middle School C is a middle class area.

Having been here for a year now you have noticed that students from middle school B and C do not perform as well at the beginning of programming in highschool  and you have decided that the best way to revisit the introduction concepts is to use block programming for all students to visually see how everything connects and use a familiar teaching programming tool.
`});
  slides.push({ type: 'Context', text:`Students from middle school A who had very good grasp of programming seems very frustrated that in high school they are using block programming and many of them are requesting to be withdrawn from CSI because they see this as beneath them programming in blocks in high schools.

 Parents are calling the school and demanding that their students not be given substandard curriculum for high school. 

How do you address the angry parents knowing  very well that your aim is to distract preparatory privilege of those students from middle school A that is considered the upper class high school and students are known to openly challenge teachers curriculum.

2. How do you check to make sure that the student from middle school B and C are not been negatively affected by the negativity that has been introduced in the classroom about block programming.
3. What do you do when you find out that students are passing around petitions to have this class changed that teachers should not teach high school using programming using block language.

My students is looking top to go to top universities. Teaching them this shallow blocking curriculum will not help.  You need to change this and start challenging my student otherwise we will have you fired.

2. Ms. Parent I want you to know that the curriculum were doing is not at all shallowing.  I am making sure that student have a proper grasp of programming techniques as well as group working  concepts because this course involves many group projects.
