`Optionally, we'd like to use your responses here for a  research study at MIT.  We would like to compare the responses across participants.

Your responses would be included in the research, along with data from your response to a survey.  All data you enter is stored securely and protected on a secure server on Google Drive, Amazon Web Services or Heroku.  You may print a copy of this form for your records. 

You can continue playing the game either way.  Participation in the research study is voluntary.

More details:
You have been asked to participate in a research study conducted by the staff and researchers at the Teaching System Laboratory (TSL) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 

Purpose of study:
The purpose of this study is to investigate how emotional expression in responses to teacher momments relates to expression. For example, we will explore expressions that indicate confusion or struggle to better understand the interplay between emotion and cognition during learning.  All participants will be over 18.

Study results:
The results of this study will be used for ongoing research conducted by TSL in preparing and supporting effective, well-prepared teachers. Results of the study will be shared through conference papers, journal articles, websites, online blogs, tweets, and other materials. All information will be reported anonymously. 

Data collection:
Data collection will include online log file data including responses participants submit within learning experiences in the form of audio and test responses.  These may include things like: written or typed responses, clicks or taps within the learning experience, or audio or video recordings participants create.  Beyond sharing and social elements directly within the learning experience, the data will be used only for analysis or to share with other participants as they choose.  Data will be stored securely in Google Drive, Amazon Web Services and Heroku. 

Participant information:
Participating in this study is voluntary. 
You will not be compensated for participating in the study.
Your email and any other personally identifiable information will be confidential.
Your anonymized responses may be shared with other players as part of the game. 

Study timeframe:
This project will be completed by December 31st, 2023.  After that date, participant data will be deleted. 

Informed Consent: 
I understand the procedures described above. My questions have been answered to my satisfaction, and I agree to participate in this study.

Contact information:
Please contact Dr. Justin Reich (jreich@mit.edu) or Garron Hillaire, (garron@mit.edu) with any questions or concerns. If you feel you have been treated unfairly, or you have questions regarding your rights as a research subject, you may contact the Chairman of the Committee on the Use of Humans as Experimental Subjects, M.I.T., Room E25-143b, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, phone 1-617-253-6787.

Having been here for a year now you have noticed that students from middle school B and C do not perform as well at the beginning of programming in highschool  and you have decided that the best way to revisit the introduction concepts is to use block programming for all students to visually see how everything connects and use a familiar teaching programming tool.

 Parents are calling the school and demanding that their students not be given substandard curriculum for high school.
